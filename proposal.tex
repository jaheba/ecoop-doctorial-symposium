\maketitle

\begin{abstract} Adaptively optimising virtual machines (VM) have found
widespread usage, which unite many advantages, including good performance and
platform independence. Alas, due to high implementation efforts only a few VMs
can deliver excellent performance. Recent research has focused on language
implementation frameworks, which promise good trade-offs between performance and
implementation efforts, including the idea of meta-tracing.\\

However, meta-traced VMs inherently have bad warmup characteristics -- meaning
that the time taken to reach peak performance is high. In my research I want to
study the warmup behaviour of meta-traced VMs in detail. Further I want to
develop and evaluate novel techniques to tackle the issue of slow warmup.
